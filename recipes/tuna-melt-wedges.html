        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit. If needed, wash celery. Cut celery in 1/2-1 inch half moons and then dice. Cut potatoes into 1/2 inch thick wedges.</li>
            <li>Place wedges in a large bowl. Drizzle with olive oil. Toss with Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and black pepper until even coated. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread wedges evenly. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning wedges over half way through.</li>
            <li>While wedges are baking, combine tuna, mayonnaise, relish, celery, dried dill, salt and pepper in a medium bowl. Butter the bottom (or outter) of each slice of bread to your liking.</li>
            <li>Place buttered side of bread slices on griddle with the two slices per sandwich touching each other. Place one slice of cheese on one slice of bread per sandwhich and sprinkle shredded cheese on the other slices. Add more or less shredded cheese to your liking. Spread tuna mix onto the slices with shredded cheese. If using a skillet, make one sandwich at a time.</li>
            <li>Turn griddle on to 250 degrees Farenheit. If using a skillet, turn to medium heat. Allow cheese to get slightly melted, about 3-5 minutes, and flip bread slice with sliced cheese onto the slice with tuna mixture. Allow cheeses to melt with tuna and bread to toast to your liking, flipping sandwiches occasionally.</li>
            <li>While sandwiches are being made, mix all ingredients for parmesan peppercorn sauce in medium bowl. Taste and add more seasoning to your liking.</li>
            <li>Once sandwiches are done, cut to your liking. Divide sandwiches and wedges between plates as well as sauce. Enjoy!</li>
