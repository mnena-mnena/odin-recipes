        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        <p>Brownies and Oreos- the best of both worlds! These brownies are fun to make and even more fun to eat. This recipe is actually a vegan recipe and can be made non-vegan if preferred.</p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>2 flax eggs, or 2 regular eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 melted coconut oil, or oil of choice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate chips, unmelted</li>
            <li>1 pack of Oreos</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees Farenheit.</li>
            <li>To melt chocolate chips, microwave for about a minute and stir to see if chips have melted. If not, continue warming in increments of 30 seconds</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, salt, and baking soda until combined well.</li>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, mix eggs, sugar, and oil until combined well, about 2 minutes. Once thoroughly combined, mix water and vanilla extract to the bowl and combine all together.</li>
            <li>Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture along with melted chocolate chips. Stir until well combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in unmelted chocolate chips. Optionally, take 4-6 crushed Oreos and stir in as well.</li>
            <li>Grease an 8x8 baking pan, or line with parchment paper. Pour a little less than half the brownie mixture. Add 9 whole Oreos on top, lining 3 by 3. Pour remaining mixture, covering Oreos. Optionally, add more crushed Oreos on top.</li>
            <li>Bake for 35 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool completely. Slice into as many pieces desired.</li>
        </ol>
