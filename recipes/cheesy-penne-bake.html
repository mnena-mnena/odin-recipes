        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees Farenheit. Wash and dry produce. Dice the tomato and mushrooms. Trim and grate the zucchini using the largest holes of a box grater.</li>
            <li>In a medium pan, heat 1 tbsp of olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms and season with seasoned salt, lemon pepper, and black pepper. Cook until liquid is released, about 10-15 minutes. Place mushrooms aside and keep the pan ready for step 4.</li>
            <li>Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain noodles.</li>
            <li>In the medium pan used for the mushrooms, heat a drizzle of oil on medium-high heat. Add tomato and a pinch of salt. Cook for about 3-5 minutes. Add marinara sauce, zucchini, vegetable stock, tomato paste, 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 1/2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp olive oil, 3/4 tsp salt, and mushrooms. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 3 more minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>While sauce is simmering, combine ricotta, 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, and a drizzle of olive oil in a bowl. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Pour noodles in the pan with the sauce and add 1 tbsp butter. Season with salt and pepper and combine well.</li>
            <li>Using an 8x8 pan, spread half the mixture as the bottom layer. Use a spoon to dollop and spead ricotta mixture (OPTIONAL: add some shredded Mozzarella on top of ricotta mixture). Add remaining pasta mixture and top with Mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Cover dish with foil that has been coated with non-stick oil. Bake for 10 minutes, remove the foil, then bake for an additional 5-10 minutes. Let it cool. Divide between plates and top with chili flakes and grated parmesan.</li>
